 ## Pyramid
Recreating these pyramids in C, albeit in text, using hashes ( # ) for bricks, as follows. Each hash is a little taller than it is wide, so the pyramids themselves are also taller than they are wide.

The program should allow the user to decide how tall the pyramid should be by first asking for a positive integer between, say, 1 and 8.
